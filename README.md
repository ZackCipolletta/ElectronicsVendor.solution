TODO:

When user clicks component type <li> in Vendor Details list:
  
  Show page specifically for all the models of that Component sold by that Vendor
  (now links to Component Details)


On Component AddVendor page:
  
  Do not show any existing Component Vendors in the dropdown list
  (via ComponentsController?)
